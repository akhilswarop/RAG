EDUCATION Bachelor’s Degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering – Amrita School of Engineering, Bangalore       08/2021 – 05/2025 RELEVANT COURSE WORK Embedded Systems Data Structures & Algorithms KEY ACADEMIC PROJECTS Microcontrollers & Interfacing Machine Learning Computer Architecture Multimedia Wireless N/W Image Compression and Processing | C Language 05/2024 • A 704x536 color JPEG image was compressed with 24 bits per pixel. Algorithms: Simple row and column replication and linear interpolation are used to up sample, followed by a 4:2:0 down sample, then a comparison. • The final RGB image was 2.8 times smaller than it was initially. The up-sampled linear interpolated image's MSE was 0.0761 in the absence of quantization. Socket Programming | TCP/IP, C Language • Designed and implemented a data transfer link between two LAN-connected university servers. • Developed client/server scripts to construct a server architecture and two clients utilizing UDP sockets. Multithreading vs Multitasking for a Robotic Assembly Line | Linux, RTOS, C Language 07/2023 10/2022 • Using the C programming language, an RTOS solution for a robotic assembly line was developed. This included task definition, the creation of distinct threads with distinct priority levels for each robot, task synchronization via semaphores and mutexes, task timing management, and the implementation of error handling mechanisms. • Moreover, message queues utilizing the inter-process communication (IPC) approach were employed to facilitate communication among the various robots and guarantee coordinated operation. • With a difference of roughly 40% and 15%, respectively, multithreading has a high average throughput and a shorter delay. WORK EXPERIENCE SAEINDIA – Battery Systems Firmware Engineer, India 08/2023 – 05/2025 •  Energy Storage was a member of a competitive design team that helped create, build, test, and race an electric vehicle in the style of Formula One. took part in the 2023 SAEINDIA. •  Fixed the overcharging problem detected by the high voltage energy storage box by coding Embedded C. Additionally, the circuit  is  designed  to  shut  down  using  an  STM32  when  a  relay  to  GPIO  detects  a  defined  high  temperature.  TMS communications are accomplished by CAN to the Master Panel Control Module, and CANalyzer is used for analysis. To keep an eye on all seven battery segments, VMS uses serial communication with three satellite modules. TECHNICAL SKILLS Languages: Python, C, C++, Kernel C, MATLAB & Simulink.

Algorithms: Simple row and column replication and linear interpolation are used to up sample, followed by a 4:2:0 down sample, then a comparison. • The final RGB image was 2.8 times smaller than it was initially. The up-sampled linear interpolated image's MSE was 0.0761 in the absence of quantization. Socket Programming | TCP/IP, C Language • Designed and implemented a data transfer link between two LAN-connected university servers. • Developed client/server scripts to construct a server architecture and two clients utilizing UDP sockets. Multithreading vs Multitasking for a Robotic Assembly Line | Linux, RTOS, C Language 07/2023 10/2022 • Using the C programming language, an RTOS solution for a robotic assembly line was developed. This included task definition, the creation of distinct threads with distinct priority levels for each robot, task synchronization via semaphores and mutexes, task timing management, and the implementation of error handling mechanisms. • Moreover, message queues utilizing the inter-process communication (IPC) approach were employed to facilitate communication among the various robots and guarantee coordinated operation. • With a difference of roughly 40% and 15%, respectively, multithreading has a high average throughput and a shorter delay. WORK EXPERIENCE SAEINDIA – Battery Systems Firmware Engineer, India 08/2023 – 05/2025 •  Energy Storage was a member of a competitive design team that helped create, build, test, and race an electric vehicle in the style of Formula One. took part in the 2023 SAEINDIA. •  Fixed the overcharging problem detected by the high voltage energy storage box by coding Embedded C. Additionally, the circuit  is  designed  to  shut  down  using  an  STM32  when  a  relay  to  GPIO  detects  a  defined  high  temperature.  TMS communications are accomplished by CAN to the Master Panel Control Module, and CANalyzer is used for analysis. To keep an eye on all seven battery segments, VMS uses serial communication with three satellite modules. TECHNICAL SKILLS Languages: Python, C, C++, Kernel C, MATLAB & Simulink.
