The AI can provide further guidance on relevant SOC codes, potential industries, and career paths.
3         1.0       The score is 1.00 because the user's skillset is well-aligned with several career paths in healthcare but lacks specific expertise needed for some higher-paying roles like physician or advanced nurse practitioners. The user should consider further specialized education or professional certifications for those roles, and explore industries where those specific skills are in high demand. This is a good starting point for a career exploration but requires additional steps to become a specialist or high-paying role.
4         1         The score is 1 because the input provided focuses on the SOC codes, titles and descriptions and does not offer any personalized guidance or insights based on the user profile.

However, the specific SOC codes and titles provided do not offer a very clear direction. The user needs to be more specific in defining career goals.

The provided context is helpful in identifying relevant SOC codes and titles for the user profile, but it lacks specific information about the user's career interests, desired salary range, preferred work settings and career goals. The context is also not tailored specifically to the user's background and skillset.
